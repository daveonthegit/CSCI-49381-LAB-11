-->Overview
      <p> </p>
      <p>The purpose of this page is to introduce you to the concept of
        Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). In this lab, you will use a
        Persistent Cross-Site Scripting attack against a web forum in
        order to steal the authentication cookie of an administrator and
        deface the forum. Then you will fix the flaw in the forum code,
        create a patch, and write about it. You should be familiar with
        the Unix command line, POSIX permissions, and basic programming.
        The exercise will also use C and HTTP, but at introductory
        levels. </p>

      <h3>Persistent Cross Site Scripting</h3>
      <p>Persistent Cross Site Scripting is an exploit where an attacker
        inserts malicious code or HTML into a persistent web page.
        Forums and “comment sections” are particularly vulnerable,
        especially when users are able to post data with arbitrary
        characters. The exploit occurs when arbitrary code (HTML and
        Javascript, for example) is simply “pasted in” to the display
        page -- think of a comment section or forum where post after
        post are concatenated together. If the user is able to include
        Javascript in the post, then, thanks to the <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy"
          target="_blank">Same Origin Policy</a> the script will run as
        if it were part of the original webpage! Since it’s part of the
        original page, it can steal things like cookies (and potentially
        passwords that might be useful on other sites) and cause the
        browser to misbehave in other ways. We prevent XSS attacks by
        validating and sanitizing user input, similar to SQL injection.
        See the following section for more information on prevention.

          href="http://excess-xss.com/" target="_blank">http://excess-xss.com/</a>.

        Sins of Software Security,” where it is Sin #2. </p>

        <p><img src="other/idea.png"> Hint: The type of XSS attack

      <h3>Input Validation and Sanitization</h3>
      <p>One of your tasks is to patch an XSS vulnerability web forum
        that allows persistent Javascript to be included in forum posts.
        The default forum code doesn’t even attempt to strip HTML tags
        from the user’s posts. Improved code exists in the forum
        software (see below) and you’ll need to enable and attack each
        improvement (there are ways to circumvent them). In addition,
        the forum users sometimes have legitimate reasons to include
        input in their post that is HTML-like. For example, users like
        to make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art"
          target="_blank">ASCII art</a> and discuss code in various
        programming languages, so we cannot simply restrict forum posts
        to alphanumeric symbols. Instead, we want to allow users to
        include any printable characters in their posts in a way that
        removes any special meanings that the characters have in HTML.
        To do this, we convert special characters (such as ‘&lt;’ or
        ‘&gt;’) in the user’s input to their corresponding <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encodings_in_HTML#HTML_character_references"
          target="_blank">HTML encoding</a>. This will tell the browser
        to just display the special character rather than interpret it
        as part of the HTML. </p>
      <p>Fortunately, most server-side scripting languages have several,
        several built in functions for validating and sanitizing string
        data. For this lab, we will focus on the PHP language, and we
        will be using its filtering functions to encode special
        characters in the user’s input. PHP has at least two functions
        for this: filter_var() and htmlspecialchars(). Generally, we
        want to use built in functions rather than home-brewed functions
        for the same reason we use well-known encryption algorithms
        rather than home-brewed algorithms. Information on these
        built-in functions is found below: <span class="anchor"
          id="filtervar"></span> </p>
      <h4>filter_var()</h4>
      <p>filter_var() takes a string to be filtered, a filter id that
        corresponds to one of PHP’s built-in filters, and an optional
        flag value. It returns the given string with the specified
        filter applied to it. The filters available for use are
        documented listed in the PHP documentation here: <a
          href="https://php.net/manual/en/filter.filters.sanitize.php"
          target="_blank">https://php.net/manual/en/filter.filters.sanitize.php</a>
      </p>
      <p>And the documentation for filter_var itself is found here: <a
          href="https://php.net/manual/en/function.filter-var.php"
          target="_blank">https://php.net/manual/en/function.filter-var.php</a>
        <span class="anchor" id="htmlspecialchars"></span> </p>
      <h4>htmlspecialchars()</h4>
      <p>htmlspecialchars() works similarly to filter_var(). It takes a
        string as input and returns the same string with a static filter
        applied to it. The transformations and additional options for
        the function can be found here: <a
          href="https://php.net/manual/en/function.htmlspecialchars.php"

      <h2>Tarball 101</h2>
      <span class="anchor" id="howtomaketarball"></span>
      <h3>How Do I Make a Tarball?</h3>
      <p>To make a gzipped tarball, you first put all your files into a
        directory, and then you combine (tar) and compress (gzip) the
        file. </p>
      <div class="warning">
        <p><img src="other/alert.png"> If you’re unfamiliar with moving
          files on the command line, please make a test tarball with
          dummy files so you don’t accidentally wreck your homework. </p>
      </div>
      <p>Step-by-step instructions to make your own tarball: </p>
      <ol>
        <li> Make a directory, e.g., using
          <p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 1rem;">$ mkdir
            foo</p>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> Make some files you want to compress (e.g., your homework).
          We can make some test files using
          <p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 1rem;">$ touch a
            b c </p>
          <br>
          … which makes three empty files, a, b, and c. </li>
        <br>
        <li> Move those files into the directory we’re going to tar:
          <p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 1rem;">$ mv a foo</p>
          <p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 1rem;">$ mv b foo</p>
          <p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 1rem;">$ mv c foo</p>
          <br>
          <p>You could also do</p>
          <p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 1rem;">$ mv a b c
            foo</p>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> Make a tarball out of the directory and it’s contents, by
          doing
          <p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 1rem;">$ tar cvzf
            foo.tar.gz foo</p>
          <br>
          That command says to tar with the options c (compress), v
          (verbose -- say what’s happening), z (compress), and f (“with
          the files specified on the command line”) and then you specify
          the compressed file to create and the directory to compress. </li>
        <br>
      </ol>
      <p>When finished, you’ll have a tarball: foo.tar.gz.<br>
      </p>
      <p>So, for this project, make a directory called xss (or
        whatever). <span class="anchor" id="howtounziptarball"></span>
      </p>
      <h3>How Do I Unzip the Tarball I Just Made?</h3>
      <p>To unzip it, do: </p>
      <p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 1rem;">$ tar xvzf
        foo.tar.gz</p>
      <p>Where the only difference is the x, which means “extract.”
        Please note that if the directory foo/ exists, it will be
        overwritten. </p>
