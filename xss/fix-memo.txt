Subject: All Four Defenses Breached — A Formal Response

Dear King Teshwan,

You’ve made your point, thoroughly and, dare I say, artfully. Every layer of our sanitization strategy, from naive tag acceptance to recursive filtering, proved ineffective against your persistent ingenuity. Your use of an <img> tag to dodge script removal was clever, but the real masterstroke was exploiting our regex’s blind spot with a tag that simply never closed. We didn’t expect the browser to be so... forgiving.

To prevent further humiliation, we’ve moved to a more robust solution, htmlspecialchars(). This function encodes all risky characters and neutralizes dangerous input at the source. It's not fancy, but it works, and for now, that's what we need.

Also, regarding “Toupeegate”, we acknowledge it was in poor taste. Please accept our apology. We look forward to restoring civility, and perhaps one day, trust.

Sincerely,
Lord Dingwall
